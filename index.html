        <ol>
            <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</li>
            <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their current score.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, all their current score for that round is lost, and it's the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>The player can choose to 'Hold' their current score, which gets added to their total score. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>The first player to reach 100 points on the total score wins the game.</li>
